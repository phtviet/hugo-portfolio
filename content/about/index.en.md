## Origin

I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and currently based in Melbourne, Australia.

## Why I made this site

I created this blog firstly as a learning experience into web development, albeit a simple one. Secondly, I aim to build and share my personal projects that are related to Data Science here for anyone interested in finding out what I do. Lastly, I also post my writings here as blog posts to share with the world. If you happen to come across and enjoy them, I'm immensely grateful! &#128522;

## Education

After completing a Bachelor degree in Economics and Finance at University of Melbourne in December 2018, I'm now working towards a Master degree in Data Science at Monash University, graduating in May 2024. 

I hope to be able to combine these two different areas (Data Science and Economics) and create projects and writings that are interesting and insightful.

## Personal interests

I like to read, and learn new things outside of my comfort zone.

> "And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for." - John Keating, *Dead Poets Society*

I also love to play tennis, and the guitar.
