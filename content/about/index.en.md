## Origin

I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and currently based in Melbourne, Australia.

## Why I made this site

As I began my job hunting process, I often feel lost and not good enough after reading the requirements for some roles that I'm interested in. Most if not all positions require minimum 2 years of experience, even for some junior roles.

As a result, I decided to create this blog firstly as a learning experience into web development, albeit a simple one. Secondly, I aim to build and share my personal projects here that are related to Data Science for anyone who is interested in finding out what I do. Lastly, I also post my occasional ramblings here as blog posts in order to further improve my writing. &#128522;

## Education

After completing a Bachelor degree in Economics and Finance at University of Melbourne in December 2018, I'm now working towards a Master degree in Data Science at Monash University, graduating in July 2022. 

I hope to be able to combine these two different areas (Data Science and Economics) and create projects that are interesting and insightful.

## Personal interests

I see myself as a man of science and numbers, but I'm particularly interested in reading, discussing and immersing in anything related to the creative arts and social sciences.

I'm also a keen tennis and guitar player. Recently, I made some efforts to learn French with Duolingo but it's not working out so far &#128517;
